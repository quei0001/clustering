Clustering App
This is a simple web application built with Streamlit that allows users to upload a CSV file, perform KMeans clustering, and visualize the results. The app enables users to choose the number of clusters for the KMeans algorithm and view the clustered data in a scatter plot.

Features
Upload a CSV file to load data.

Perform KMeans clustering on two features (Feature1 and Feature2).

Choose the number of clusters (between 2 and 10).

Visualize the clusters in a scatter plot.

Prerequisites
Before running the app, make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.7 or higher
Streamlit
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn
You can install these dependencies by running the following command:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Folder Structure
The project is organized into the following files:

bash
Copy
Edit
/your_project
│
├── app.py             # Main Streamlit application
├── utils.py           # Data loading and preprocessing functions
├── predictor.py       # KMeans clustering runner
├── model.py           # KMeans model logic
└── requirements.txt   # Project dependencies
Description of Each File:
app.py: This is the main file for the Streamlit app. It handles the user interface and coordinates the flow of data and analysis.

utils.py: Contains utility functions for loading and preprocessing the uploaded CSV file. It cleans and prepares the data for clustering.

predictor.py: Responsible for calling the KMeans model logic (in model.py), running the clustering, and preparing the output (cluster labels and centroids).

model.py: Contains the logic for creating and fitting the KMeans clustering model.

requirements.txt: Lists all the required dependencies for the project. To install them, simply run pip install -r requirements.txt.

How to Run the App
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-repository-folder>
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Streamlit app:

bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py
Open the app in your browser (Streamlit will provide a local URL like http://localhost:8501).

Upload your CSV file through the app interface. Make sure your CSV file has two numeric columns (Feature1 and Feature2) for clustering.

Select the number of clusters you want to use, and the app will show the clustered data in a scatter plot.

Sample Data
Your CSV file should have at least two numeric columns (e.g., Feature1 and Feature2). Here’s an example format for your CSV file:

Feature1	Feature2
5.0	10.2
3.4	8.9
8.1	15.2
4.3	12.5
...	...
